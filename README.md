Millions of people worldwide are suffering from mental disorder called Depression. An
individual who is suffering from depression functions, is vulnerable to other diseases and in 
the worst-case, depression leads to suicide. However, a large percentage of cases of depression 
go undiagnosed and, thus, untreated. Previous studies have found that messages posted by 
individuals with major depressive disorder on social media platforms can be analyzed to predict 
if they are suffering, or likely to suffer, from depression. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) suggests that people who are depressed are regularly not correctly diagnosed and others 
who are misdiagnosed are prescribed antidepressants. Thus, there is a strong need to 
automatically assess the risk of depression. Social media platforms increasingly come closer to 
become a true digitization of the human social experience. In many cases, people would in fact 
prefer to express themselves online than offline. Nowadays, depression is a common mental 
illness. Failure to recognize depression early, guarantees that a depressed individual receives 
prompt counseling can lead to serious issues. Social media allow us to monitor people's 
thoughts, daily activities, and emotions, including persons with mental illnesses. My Project 
aims to address the task of depression level classification based on text data and emotion data 
with a comparative analysis using **ML and DL models**.
